Customer behavior analysis is the process of analyzing and understanding the actions, patterns, and preferences of customers in order to gain insights into their buying behavior. This involves collecting and analyzing data on customers' browsing and purchasing activities to identify trends, preferences, and patterns in their behavior. The goal of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of customers and their needs in order to build stronger and more profitable relationships with them using the obtained dataset. In this project we will focus on campaign analysis performance and identify the sales of products, so one could evaluate the campaign strategy and recognizing which products that show high and low sales performance.
