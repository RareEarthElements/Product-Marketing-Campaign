# Business Problem
Customer behavior analysis is the process of analyzing and understanding the actions, patterns, and preferences of customers in order to gain insights into their buying behavior. This involves collecting and analyzing data on customers' browsing and purchasing activities to identify trends, preferences, and patterns in their behavior. The goal of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of customers and their needs in order to build stronger and more profitable relationships with them using the obtained dataset. In this project we will focus on campaign analysis performance and identify the sales of products, so one could evaluate the campaign strategy and recognizing which products that show high and low sales performance.

# Data Analytics

Results from observation data analysis, as follows:
* The products that consumers spent the most money on during the 2-year period were Wine (50.3%) and Meat product (27.5%).

* Customers who purchase wine commodities also tend to purchase meat and vice versa, indicating a potential relationship or preference between the two products.

* Generally the highest transaction occured during the last marketing campaign with 33.5% and the lowest transaction occured during the 2nd phase of marketing campaign by 3.0%.

* The correlations of NumCatalogPurchases with MntWines and MntMeatProducts are 0.822926 and 0.853744 respectively. This is evidence of the strong relationship between wine and meat purchases through catalog purchasing.

* The majority of customers who buy wine have a graduate level of education and above, whether they live in a couple or alone.

* The age range of customers who buy wine is the majority at the age of >75 followed by the age group <30, while for the age range of customers who buy meat the majority are the age group <30 then >75.

Based on data analysis, in order to increase sales we need to design a marketing strategy similar to the last marketing strategy in the previous campaign, we suggest to give promos for transactions made with catalogs for wine and meat products, because there is a high correlation between transactions through catalogs for wine and meat products, this marketing strategy can target age groups under 30 and over 75 years old, with a minimum education level of graduate, both for those who live alone or who are married.

# Business Implementation
If the selling price of a piece of meat is 7 € and a bottle of wine is 10 €, and if the profit from the sale of meat products is 4 € and wine is 6 € per unit and if the number of products sold for meat is 5,000 pieces and wine is 5,000 bottles for a period of time, with a meat procurement capital of 3 € per piece and a wine procurement capital of 4 € per bottle. Therefore, the company needs €35,000 in capital to procure wine and meat products. If the implementation of the marketing strategy recommended by the data analysis is successful, it is expected to sell 5,000 bottles of wine and 5,000 pieces of meat. This can contribute to an income of €50,000 from the sale of these two products, hence the company will earn a revenue of €15,000 or in other words, a profit of about 42.86%.
